SHA-1 Hash Cracking:

If you choose to crack a SHA-1 hash, the program will employ a multi-stage approach to recover the original password:

Dictionary Attack: The program will first attempt to crack the hash using a dictionary attack, searching for a match in a predefined list of common passwords.

Hybrid Dictionary Attack: If the dictionary attack is unsuccessful, the program will proceed to a hybrid dictionary attack, combining common passwords with variations and mutations to increase the chances of finding a match.

Brute Force Attack: If the hybrid dictionary attack fails, the program will resort to a brute force attack, systematically trying all possible combinations of characters to recover the original password.
